If you been surprised with a message in your Microsoft Account Security settings that says *“Account security info change still pending,”*  then it is nothing alarming but needs a check if you don’t remember anything that could have caused it. The message appears when you have recently removed old info data with new.

## What is Microsoft Account Security Info?

When you create a Microsoft account, you also add an alternate contact email address or phone number. They come in handy when you need to reset your password or change any info, which is crucial to the account. An email or phone number is always sent to the alternate account for verification to keep someone else trying to take over your account. This process makes sure that Microsoft knows it is who you own the account.
